\item{control_name}{Character name of controls within metadata}

\item{control_order}{Vector ordering run of sample_type controls, default NA}

\item{blocklist}{Vector of known previously identified contaminant features}

\item{remove_if}{Threshold for number of steps feature must be identified as potential contaminant to be removed from final cleaned count matrix. Default set to 1.}

\item{step2_threshold}{Threshold value for prevalence method of decontam}

\item{technical_replicates}{Vector identifying technical replicates across batches}

\item{seed}{Random seed}
}
\value{
